## Geostatistical problems

> "Conventional geostatistical methodology solves the problem of predicting the realized value of a linear functional of a Gaussian spatial stochastic process $S(x)$ based on observations $Y_i= S(x_i) + Z_i$ at sampling locations $x_i$, where the $Z_i$ are mutually independent, zero-mean Gaussian random variables."

## Defining the predictive target

. . .

-   **Spatially continuous targets** correspond to an unobserved spatially continuous surface (e.g. disease prevalence), formally denoted by $\mathcal{T} = \{T(x), x \in A\}$, where $A$ is our region of interest.

. . .

-   **Areal-level targets**, usually defined as transformation of the spatially continuous surface $\mathcal{T}$, defined previously, and which we denote as $\mathcal{T}_{A} = F(\mathcal{T}, A)$.

## Examples of predictive target {.scrollable}

| Predictive target $T(x)$ | Name | GLM family |
|---------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| $d(x)^\top \beta + S(x)$ | Linear predictor | Any GLM |
| $\frac{\exp\{d(x)^\top \beta + S(x)\}}{1+\exp\{d(x)^\top \beta + S(x)\}}$ | Prevalence | Binomial |
| $\exp\{d(x)^\top \beta + S(x)\}$ | Mean number of cases | Poisson |
| $S(x)$ | Spatial random effects | Any GLM |
| $d(x)^\top \beta$ | Covariates effects | Any GLM |

## Steps for the geostistical prediction of $T(x)$ {.smaller .scrollable}

**Preliminary steps:**

-   Obtain the **shapefile** of the boundaries of the study area.
-   Generate a **regular grid** that covers the study for the desired spatial resolution, using the shapefile.
-   Extract all the **covariates** used in the model on the grid and ensure that there are no missing values.

. . .

**Prediction steps** (for a given location $x$ on the grid):

1.  Generate samples from the predictive distribution of $S(x) \: | \: y$, say $S_{(j)}(x)$, for $j = 1, \ldots, B$.

. . .

2.  Apply the transformation defined by $T(x)$ to each of the samples $S_{(j)}(x)$, to obtain $T_{(j)}(x)$, for $j = 1, \ldots, B$.

. . .

3.  Using the Monte Carlo samples $T_{(j)}(x)$, obtain the desired summaries of the predictive distribution:

    -   Mean: $\overline{T}_B = B^{-1} \sum_{j=1}^B T_{(j)}(x)$

    -   Standard deviation: $\left[B^{-1} \sum_{j=1}^B (T_{(j)}(x) - \overline{T}_B)^2\right]^{1/2}$

    -   Prediction intervals at 95$\%$ coverage level

    -   Exceedance probabilities: $B^{-1} \sum_{j=1}^B I(T_{(j)}(x) > L)$, for a given threshold $L$.

. . .

## Marginal vs joint predictions {.smaller}

-   Let $\tilde{X} = (\tilde{x}_1, \ldots, \tilde{x}_q)$ be the set of prediciton locations that make up the regular grid.

. . .

-   **Marginal predictions** are obtained by simulating independently from the $q$ marginal predictive distributions of $[S(\tilde{X}) | y]$. In other words, we consider a prediction location $\tilde{x}_j$, simulate from $[S(\tilde{x}_j) \: |\: y]$ say $B$ samples, and repeat this for $j=1,\ldots,q$

. . .

-   **Joint predictions** are obtained by simulating from the joint distribution of $[S(\tilde{X}) \: |\: y]$. Unlike marginal predictions, joint predictions take into account the correlation between the different components of $[S(\tilde{X}) \: |\: y]$.

. . .

-   When the target is $T(x)$, i.e. at pixel-level, we can use either marginal or joint predictions.

. . .

-   When the target is areal level (see next slides), we can ONLY use joint predictions.

## Areal-level targets: questions to consider

1.  What spatially continuous target, $T(x)$, are we seeking to aggregate?
2.  What are the spatial units, denoted as $A_i$ for $i = 1, \dots, N$, over which the aggregation is required?
3.  What aggregating function should be applied?
4.  Should spatial weights be incorporated in the aggregation, and if so, what weights are appropriate?

## Example: regional average prevalence {.smaller .scrollable}

-   Let $T(x) = \exp\{d(x)^\top \beta + S(x) \}/(1+\exp\{d(x)^\top \beta + S(x)\})$

. . .

-   Average (unweighted) prevalence $$
    \mathcal{M}_i = \frac{1}{|A_i|}\int_{A_i} T(x) \: dx.
    $$

. . .

-   Average weighted prevalence $$
    \mathcal{M}_i = \frac{\int_{A_i} w(x) T(x) \: dx}{\int_{A_i} w(x) \: dx}.
    $$

. . .

-   We approximate the above integrals using the regular grid, e.g.

$$\mathcal{M}_i \approx \frac{1}{\#\{j : \tilde{x}_j \in A_i\}} \sum_{\tilde{x}_j \in A_i} T(\tilde{x}_j), $$

for the unweighted regional prevalence.

## Steps for the geostistical prediction of areal targets {.smaller .scrollable}

**Preliminary steps:**

-   Obtain the **shapefile** of the study area.
-   Obtain the **shapefiles** of the boundaries of the regions for which aggregation is required.
-   Generate a **regular grid** that covers the study for the desired spatial resolution, using the shapefile.
-   Extract all the **covariates** used in the model on the grid and ensure that there are no missing values.
-   For weighted areal level target, extract all the **weights** on the grid and ensure that there are no missing values.

. . .

**Prediction steps** (for a given location $x$ on the grid):

1.  (*Joint prediction*) Generate samples from the predictive distribution of $S(x) \: | \: y$, say $S_{(j)}(x)$, for $j = 1, \ldots, B$.

. . .

2.  Apply the transformation defined by $T(x)$ to each of the samples $S_{(j)}(x)$, to obtain $T_{(j)}(x)$, for $j = 1, \ldots, B$.

. . .

3.  Aggregate the samples $T_{(j)}(x)$ for each region $A_i$ to obtain samples of the areal-level predictive target $\mathcal{M}_i$. Denote these samples as $\mathcal{M}_i^{(j)}$.

4.  Obtain the desired summaries of the predictive distribution of $\mathcal{M}_i$. Examples:

    -   Mean: $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{i,B} = B^{-1} \sum_{j=1}^B \mathcal{M}_i^{(j)}$

    -   Standard deviation: $\left[B^{-1} \sum_{j=1}^B (\mathcal{M}_i^{(j)} - \overline{\mathcal{M}}_{i,B})^2\right]^{1/2}$

    -   Prediction intervals at 95$\%$ coverage level

    -   Exceedance probabilities: $B^{-1} \sum_{j=1}^B I(\mathcal{M}_{i}^{(j)} > L)$, for a given threshold $L$.
